        unmask._) Michael, recite the oath.<br>

        MICHAEL. To strangle whatever nature is in us; neither to love nor to be
        loved, neither to pity nor to be pitied, neither to marry nor to be
        given in marriage, till the end is come; to stab secretly by night; to
        drop poison in the glass; to set father against son, and husband against
        wife; without fear, without hope, without future, to suffer, to
        annihilate, to revenge.<br>
