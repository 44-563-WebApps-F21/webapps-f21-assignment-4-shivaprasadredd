        (_Clock strikes. CONSPIRATORS form a semicircle in the middle of the stage._)<br>

        [2]PRESIDENT. What is the word?<br>

        <h6 class= "name">FIRST CONSP</h6><p>Nabat.</p>

        <h6 class= "name">PRES</h6><p>The answer?</p>

        <h6 class= "name">SECOND CONSP</h6><p> Kalit.</p>

        <h6 class= "name">PRES</h6><p>What hour is it?</p>

       <h6 class= "name" >THIRD CONSP</h6><p>The hour to suffer.</p>

        <h6 class= "name" >PRES</h6><p> What day?</p>

        <h6 class= "name" >FOURTH CONSP</h6><p>The day of oppression.</p>

       <h6 class= "name" > PRES</h6><p>The Galil√¶an had less to conquer the world; but what is our mission?</p>

        <h6 class= "name">NINTH CONSP</h6><p></p>To obey.</p>

        <h6 class= "name">PRES</h6><p>Brothers, the questions have been answered well. There are none
        but Nihilists present. Let us see each other's faces. (_The CONSPIRATORS
        unmask._) Michael, recite the oath.</p>

        <h6 class= "name">MICHAEL</h6><p> To strangle whatever nature is in us; neither to love nor to be
        loved, neither to pity nor to be pitied, neither to marry nor to be
        given in marriage, till the end is come; to stab secretly by night; to
        drop poison in the glass; to set father against son, and husband against
        wife; without fear, without hope, without future, to suffer, to
        annihilate, to revenge.</p>

        <h6 class= "name">PRES</h6> <p>Are we all agreed?</p>

        <h6 class= "name">CONSPIRATORS</h6>. <p></p>We are all agreed. (_They disperse in various directions
        about the stage._)</p>

        <h6 class= "name">PRES</h6> <p>'Tis after the hour, Michael, and she is not yet here.</p>
